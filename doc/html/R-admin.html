<h2 class="unnumbered">R Installation and Administration</h2>

<p>This is a guide to installation and administration for R.

   <p>The current version of this document is 2.1.1 (2005-06-20).

   <p>ISBN 3-900051-09-7

<p><a name="Obtaining-R"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">1 Obtaining R</h2>

<p><a name="index-Obtaining-R-1"></a>
Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>, the &ldquo;Comprehensive R Archive Network&rdquo; whose current
members are listed at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>.

<p><a name="Getting-and-unpacking-the-sources"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Getting and unpacking the sources</h3>

<p><a name="index-Sources-for-R-2"></a>
The simplest way is to download the most recent
<span class="file">R-</span><var>x</var><span class="file">.</span><var>y</var><span class="file">.</span><var>z</var><span class="file">.tgz</span> file, and unpack it with

<pre class="example">     tar xvfz R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>.tgz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on systems that have <acronym>GNU</acronym> <span class="command">tar</span> installed.  On other
systems you need at least to have the <span class="command">gzip</span> program installed. 
Then you can use

<pre class="example">     gzip -dc R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>.tgz | tar xvf -
</pre>
   <p>The pathname of the directory into which the sources are unpacked should
not contain spaces, as <code>make</code> (specifically <acronym>GNU</acronym> make
3.80) does not expect spaces.

   <p>If you need to transport the sources on floppy disks, you can download
the <span class="file">R-</span><var>x</var><span class="file">.</span><var>y</var><span class="file">.</span><var>z</var><span class="file">.tgz-split.*</span> files and paste them
together at the destination with (Unix)

<pre class="example">     cat R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>-split.* &gt; R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>.tgz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and proceed as above.  If you want the build to be usable by a group of
users, set <code>umask</code> before unpacking so that the files will be
readable by the target group (e.g., <code>umask 022</code> to be usable by all
users).

<p><a name="Getting-patched-and-development-versions"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Getting patched and development versions</h3>

<p>A patched version of the current release, <span class="samp">r-patched</span> and the
current development version, <span class="samp">r-devel</span>, are available as daily
tarballs and via access to the R Subversion repository.

   <p>The tarballs are available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/pub/Software/R/">ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/pub/Software/R/</a>.  Download either
<span class="file">R-patched.tar.gz</span> or <span class="file">R-devel.tar.gz</span> (or the <span class="file">.tar.bz2</span>
versions) and unpack as described in the previous section.  They are
built in exactly the same way as distributions of R releases.

<p><a name="Using-Subversion-and-rsync"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 Using Subversion and rsync</h4>

<p>Sources are also available via <a href="https://svn.R-project.org/R/">https://svn.R-project.org/R/</a>, the
R Subversion repository.  If you have a Subversion client (see
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>), you can check out and update the
current r-devel from <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/">https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/</a> and the
current r-patched from
<span class="samp">https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">-patches/</span>
(where <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are the major and minor number of the current
released version of R).  E.g., use

<pre class="example">     svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ <var>path</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to check out r-devel into directory <var>path</var>.

   <p>Note that <span class="samp">https:</span> is required, and that the SSL certificate for
the Subversion server of the R project is

<pre class="example">     Certificate information:
      - Hostname: svn.r-project.org
      - Valid: from Jul 16 08:10:01 2004 GMT until Jul 14 08:10:01 2014 GMT
      - Issuer: Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, CH
      - Fingerprint: c9:5d:eb:f9:f2:56:d1:04:ba:44:61:f8:64:6b:d9:33:3f:93:6e:ad
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(currently, there is no &ldquo;trusted certificate&rdquo;).  You can accept this
certificate permanently and will not be asked about it anymore.

   <p>The Subversion repository does not contain the current sources for the
recommended packages, which can be obtained by <code>rsync</code> or
downloaded from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  To use <code>rsync</code> to install the
appropriate sources for the recommended packages, run
<span class="command">./tools/rsync-recommended</span> from the top-level of the R
sources.

   <p>If downloading manually from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>, do ensure that you have the correct
versions of the recommended packages: if the number in the file
<span class="file">VERSION</span> is <var>x</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>z</var> you need to download
the contents of <span class="samp">http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/</span><var>dir</var>,
where <var>dir</var> is <var>x</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>z</var><span class="samp">/Recommended</span> for
r-devel or <var>x</var><span class="file">.</span><var>y</var><span class="file">.</span><var>z</var><span class="file">-patched/Recommended</span> for
r-patched, respectively, to directory <span class="file">src/library/Recommended</span> in
the sources you have unpacked.  After downloading manually you need to
execute <span class="command">tools/link-recommended</span> from the top level of the
sources to make the requisite links in <span class="file">src/library/Recommended</span>. 
A suitable incantation from the top level of the R sources using
<span class="command">wget</span> might be

<pre class="example">     wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A\*.gz -nd -P src/library/Recommended \
       http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/<var>dir</var>
     ./tools/link-recommended
</pre>
   <p><a name="Installing-R-under-Unix_002dalikes"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Installing R under Unix-alikes</h2>

<p><a name="index-Installing-under-Unix_002dalikes-3"></a>
R will configure and build under a number of common Unix and
Unix-alike platforms including<var>cpu</var>-*-linux-gnu for the alpha,
amd64, arm, hppa, ix86, ia64, m68k, powerpc, and sparc CPUs (see e.g. 
<a href="http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?&amp;pkg=r-base">http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?&amp;pkg=r-base</a>),
powerpc-apple-darwin and sparc-sun-solaris, as well as probably (it is
tested less frequently on these) i386-*-freebsd, i386-*-netbsd,
i386-*-openbsd, i386-sun-solaris, mips-sgi-irix, alpha-dec-osf*,
rs6000-ibm-aix and hppa-hp-hpux.

   <p><a name="index-Linux-4"></a><a name="index-Mac-OS-X-5"></a>In addition, binary distributions are available for some common Linux
distributions and for Mac OS X (on PowerPC).  See the <acronym>FAQ</acronym> for current
details.  These are installed in platform-specific ways, so for the rest
of this chapter we consider only building from the sources.

<p><a name="Simple-compilation"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Simple compilation</h3>

<p>First review the essential and useful tools and libraries in
<a href="#Essential-and-useful-other-programs-in-Unix">Essential and useful other programs in Unix</a>, and install those you want or
need.  Ensure that the environment variable <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> is either unset
(and <span class="file">/tmp</span> exists and can be written in and executed from) or
points to a valid temporary directory.

   <p><a name="index-R_005fHOME-6"></a>Choose a place to install the R tree (R is not just a binary, but
has additional data sets, help files, font metrics etc).  Let us call
this place <var>R_HOME</var>.  Untar the source code.  This should create
directories <span class="file">src</span>, <span class="file">doc</span>, and several more.  (At this point
North American readers should consult <a href="#Setting-paper-size">Setting paper size</a>.)  Issue
the following commands:

   <p><a name="index-configure-7"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(See <a href="#Using-make">Using make</a> if your make is not called <span class="samp">make</span>.)

   <p>Then check the built system works correctly, by

<pre class="example">     make check
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Failures are not necessarily problems as they might be caused by missing
functionality, but you should look carefully at any reported
discrepancies.  To re-run the tests you would need

<pre class="example">     make check FORCE=FORCE
</pre>
   <p>More comprehensive testing can be done by

<pre class="example">     make check-devel
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     make check-all
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">see <span class="file">tests/README</span>.

   <p>If these commands execute successfully, the R binary will be copied
to the <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin</span> directory.  In addition, a shell-script
front-end called <span class="file">R</span> will be created and copied to the same
directory.  You can copy this script to a place where users can invoke
it, for example to <span class="file">/usr/local/bin/R</span>.  You could also copy the man
page <span class="file">R.1</span> to a place where your <span class="command">man</span> reader finds it,
such as <span class="file">/usr/local/man/man1</span>.  If you want to install the complete
R tree to, e.g., <span class="file">/usr/local/lib/R</span>, see <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>. 
Note: you do not <em>need</em> to install R: you can run it from where
it was built.

   <p>You do not necessarily have to build R in the top-level source
directory (say, <var>TOP_SRCDIR</var>).  To build in
<var>BUILDDIR</var>, run

   <p><a name="index-configure-8"></a>
<pre class="example">     cd <var>BUILDDIR</var>
     <var>TOP_SRCDIR</var>/configure
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and so on, as described further below.  This has the advantage of always
keeping your source tree &ldquo;clean&rdquo;.  (You may need <acronym>GNU</acronym>
<span class="command">make</span> to allow this, and the pathname of the build directory
should not contain spaces.)

   <p><a name="index-Help-pages-9"></a>Make will also build plain text help pages as well as <acronym>HTML</acronym> and
LaTeX versions of the R object documentation (the three kinds can
also be generated separately using <code>make help</code>, <code>make html</code>
and <code>make latex</code>).  Note that you need Perl version 5: if this is
not available on your system, you can obtain PDF versions of the
documentation files via <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.

   <p>For those obtaining R <em>via</em> Subversion, one additional step is
necessary:
<a name="index-Vignettes-10"></a>
<pre class="example">     make vignettes
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which makes the <span class="samp">grid</span> vignettes (which are contained in the tarballs):
it takes several minutes.

   <p>Now <code>rehash</code> if necessary, type <kbd>R</kbd>, and read the R manuals
and the R <acronym>FAQ</acronym> (files <span class="file">FAQ</span> or
<span class="file">doc/manual/R-FAQ.html</span>, or
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html</a> which always has
the latest version).

<p><a name="Making-the-manuals"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Making the manuals</h3>

<p><a name="index-Manuals-11"></a>
There is a set of manuals that can be built from the sources,

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">refman</span><dd>Printed versions of all the help pages. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">R-FAQ</span><dd>R <acronym>FAQ</acronym>
<br><dt><span class="samp">R-intro</span><dd>&ldquo;An Introduction to R&rdquo;. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">R-data</span><dd>&ldquo;R Data Import/Export&rdquo;. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">R-admin</span><dd>&ldquo;R Installation and Administration&rdquo;, this manual. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">R-exts</span><dd>&ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo;. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">R-lang</span><dd>&ldquo;The R Language Definition&rdquo;. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">To make these, use

<pre class="example">     make dvi      <span class="roman">to create DVI versions</span>
     make pdf      <span class="roman">to create PDF versions</span>
     make info     <span class="roman">to create info files (not refman).</span>
</pre>
   <p>You will not be able to build the info files unless you have
<span class="command">makeinfo</span> version 4.7 or later installed.

   <p>The DVI versions can be previewed and printed using standard programs
such as <span class="command">xdvi</span> and <span class="command">dvips</span>.  The PDF versions can be
viewed using Acrobat Reader or (fairly recent versions of)
<span class="command">ghostscript</span>: they have hyperlinks that can be followed in
Acrobat Reader.  The info files are suitable for reading online with
Emacs or the standalone <acronym>GNU</acronym> Info.  The DVI and PDF versions
will be created using the papersize selected at configuration (default
ISO a4):  this can be overridden by setting <span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span> on the
<span class="command">make</span> command line, or setting <span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span> in the
environment and using <span class="command">make -e</span>.  (If re-making the manuals for
a different papersize, you should first delete the file
<span class="file">doc/manual/version.texi</span>.)

   <p>There are some issues with making the reference manual, and in
particular with the PDF version <span class="file">refman.pdf</span>.  The help files
contain both ISO Latin1 characters (e.g. in <span class="file">text.Rd</span>) and upright
quotes, neither of which are contained in the standard LaTeX Computer
Modern fonts.  We have provided four alternatives:

     <dl>
<dt><code>times</code><dd>Using standard PostScript fonts.  This works well both for on-screen
viewing and for printing, and is the default from R 2.0.0.  The one
disadvantage is that the Usage and Examples sections may come out rather
wide.

     <br><dt><code>lm</code><dd>Using the <em>Latin Modern</em> fonts.  These are not often installed as
part of a TeX distribution, but can obtained from
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm</a> and mirrors. 
This uses fonts rather similar to Computer Modern, but is not so good
on-screen as <code>times</code>.

     <br><dt><code>cm-super</code><dd>Using type-1 versions of the Computer Modern fonts by Vladimir Volovich. 
This is a large installation, obtainable from
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super</a> and its
mirrors.  These type-1 fonts have poor hinting and so are nowhere near
so readable on-screen as the other three options.

     <br><dt><code>ae</code><dd>A package to use composites of Computer Modern fonts.  This works well
most of the time, and its PDF is more readable on-screen than the
previous two options.  There are three fonts for which it will need to
use bitmapped fonts, <span class="file">tctt0900.600pk</span>, <span class="file">tctt1000.600pk</span> and
<span class="file">tcrm1000.600pk</span>.  Unfortunately, if those files are not available,
Acrobat Reader will substitute completely incorrect glyphs so you need
to examine the logs carefully.  This was the default in R version
1.x.y. 
</dl>

   <p>Both Unix and Windows installations default to <code>times</code>.  The choice
can be overridden by setting the environment variable <code>R_RD4PDF</code>. 
(On Unix, this will be picked up at install time.)  The default value is
<code>times,hyper</code>: omit <code>hyper</code> if you do not want hyperlinks,
e.g. for printing.

<p><a name="Installation"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Installation-12"></a>
To ensure that the installed tree is usable by the right group of users,
set <code>umask</code> appropriately (perhaps to <span class="samp">022</span>) before unpacking
the sources and throughout the build process.

   <p>After

   <p><a name="index-configure-13"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
     make check
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">have been completed successfully, you can install the complete R tree
to your system by typing

<pre class="example">     make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will install to the following directories:

     <dl>
<dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/bin or </span><var>bindir</var><dd>the front-end shell script
<br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/man/man1 or </span><var>mandir</var><span class="file">/man1</span><dd>the man page
<br><dt><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib/R or </span><var>libdir</var><span class="file">/R</span><dd>all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, <small class="dots">...</small>)
</dl>

<p class="noindent">where <var>prefix</var> is determined during configuration (typically
<span class="file">/usr/local</span>) and can be set by running <span class="command">configure</span> with
the option <span class="option">--prefix</span>, as in

   <p><a name="index-configure-14"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This causes <span class="command">make install</span> to install the R executable to
<span class="file">/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin</span>, and so on.  The prefix of the
installation directories can be seen in the status message that is
displayed at the end of <span class="command">configure</span>.  You can install into
another directory tree by using

<pre class="example">     make prefix=/path/to/here install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">at least with GNU <span class="command">make</span>.

   <p>More precise control is available at configure time via options: see
<span class="command">configure --help</span> for details.  (However, most of them are
currently ignored, but <code>bindir</code>, <code>libdir</code> and <code>mandir</code>
are supported.)

   <p><a name="index-Manuals_002c-installing-15"></a>
To install DVI, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use one or more of

<pre class="example">     make install-dvi
     make install-info
     make install-pdf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Once again, it is optional to specify <code>prefix</code>. For info, the
setting used is that of <code>infodir</code> (default
<var>prefix</var><code>/info</code>, set by configure option <span class="option">--infodir</span>).

<p><a name="Uninstallation"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Uninstallation</h3>

<p>You can uninstall R by

<pre class="example">     make uninstall
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifying <code>prefix</code> etc in the same way as specified for
installation.

   <p>This will also uninstall any installed manuals.  There are specific
targets to uninstall DVI, info and PDF manuals in
<span class="file">doc/manual/Makefile</span>.

<p><a name="Installing-R-under-Windows"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Installing R under Windows</h2>

<p><a name="index-Installing-under-Windows-16"></a>
The <span class="file">bin/windows</span> directory of a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> site contains
binaries for a base distribution and a large number of add-on packages
from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> to run on Windows 95, 98, NT4, 2000, ME and XP (at
least) on Intel x86 and clones (but not on other platforms).

   <p>You do need one of those Windows versions: Windows 3.11+win32s will not
work.

   <p>Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except
perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

   <p>Installation is <em>via</em> the installer <span class="file">rw2011.exe</span>. 
Just double-click on the icon and follow the instructions.  You can
uninstall R from the Control Panel.

   <p>See the <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html">R Windows <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a> for more details.

<p><a name="Building-from-source"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Building from source</h3>

<p><a name="Getting-the-tools"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Getting the tools</h4>

<p>If you want to build R from the sources, you will first need
to collect, install and test an extensive set of tools.  See
<a href="#The-Windows-toolset">The Windows toolset</a> (and updates in
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/</a>) for details.

   <p>Be sure to set your path in the order given in the appendix.

<p><a name="Getting-the-source-files"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Getting the source files</h4>

<p>You need to collect the following sets of files:
     <ul>
<li>Get the R source code <span class="file">R-2.1.1.tgz</span> from
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  Open a commands window (or another shell) at a
directory <em>whose path does not contain spaces</em>.  We will call this
directory <var>R_HOME</var> below.  Run
     <pre class="example">          tar zxvf R-2.1.1.tgz
     </pre>
     <p>to create the source tree in <var>R_HOME</var>.  <strong>Beware</strong>: do use
<code>tar</code> to extract the sources rather than broken tools such as
WinZip that don't understand about symbolic links.

     <li>Extract the international character support file <span class="file">iconv.dll</span> from
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/iconv.zip">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/iconv.zip</a> and put it in
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/unicode</span>.

     <li>The TclTk support files are in
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/R_Tcl.zip">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/R_Tcl.zip</a>: unzip this in
<var>R_HOME</var>, and it will add directories <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/Tcl</span>,
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/Tcl/bin</span>, etc.

     <li>You need <code>libpng</code> and <code>jpeg</code> sources (available, e.g., from
<a href="http://www.libpng.org">http://www.libpng.org</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/</a>[png,jpeg]. 
You will need files <span class="file">libpng-1.2.8.tar.gz</span> and
<span class="file">jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz</span> or later.

     <li>You need to obtain copies of the recommended packages from
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  Put the <span class="file">.tar.gz</span> files in
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/library/Recommended</span>.  If you have <code>rsync</code>
and an Internet connection, you can do this automatically using
     <pre class="example">          make rsync-recommended
     </pre>
     <li>Optionally, you can install an ATLAS
(<a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/</a>) tuned to your system for fast
linear algebra routines. Prebuilt <code>Rblas.dll</code> for various Pentium
and AthlonXP chips are available in the <span class="file">windows/contrib/ATLAS</span>
area on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.

     <p>Another tuned BLAS which is available for some CPUs is by Kazushige

available via
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kgoto/signup_first.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kgoto/signup_first.html</a>.  To make
use of this, put the <span class="file">DLL</span> somewhere in your path or in
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin</span>, and edit
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/MkRules</span> to define <code>USE_GOTO=YES</code>
and the name of the <span class="file">DLL</span> (something like
<span class="file">libgoto_p4_512-r0.9.dll</span>).

     <p>Goto's BLAS takes preference over ATLAS, and seems a little faster. 
However, as it is compiled for MSVC, we have been unable to make it
work for complex arithmetic and so it is only used in for real linear
algebra.

     <p>Dr. Goto supplies DLLs for PIII, P4 and Opteron processors: that for
PIIIs runs on AthlonXP as well.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.3 Building the core files</h4>

<p>You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we found
that a <span class="command">samba</span>-mounted file system (which maps all file names to
lower case) did not work.

   <p>Open a commands window at <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32</span>.  Edit
<span class="file">MkRules</span> to set the appropriate paths as needed and to set the
type(s) of help that you want built.  <strong>Beware</strong>: <span class="file">MkRules</span>
contains tabs and some editors (e.g. WinEdt) silently remove them.  Then
run
<pre class="example">     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and sit back and wait while the basic compile takes place.

   <p>Notes:
     <ul>
<li>The file <span class="file">bin/Rchtml.dll</span> is only built if CHM help is specified in
<span class="file">MkRules</span>. Its source is the help directory, and you need the
<acronym>HTML</acronym> Help Workshop files to build it.  You can just copy this from a
binary distribution.

     <li>We have had reports that earlier versions of Norton Anti-Virus
lock up the machine when <code>windres</code> is run, so you may need to disable
it. (Norton Anti-Virus 2002 causes no problems.)

     <li>By default Doug Lea's <code>malloc</code> in the file
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/malloc.c</span> is used for R's internal memory
allocations.  You can opt out of this by commenting the line
<code>LEA_MALLOC=YES</code> in <span class="file">MkRules</span>, in which case the
<code>malloc</code> in <span class="file">msvcrt.dll</span> is used.  This does work but
imposes a considerable performance penalty.

     <li>You can run a parallel make by e.g.
     <pre class="example">          make -j2
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">but this is only likely to be worthwhile on a dual-processor (or
perhaps a hyperthreaded P4) machine with ample (at least 384Mb) of
memory.  On a dual AthlonXP it reduced the build time by about 30%
whereas on a single P4HT it reduced it by 10%.  Note that this may
sometimes stop and have to be restarted.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.4 Building the bitmap files</h4>

<p><a name="index-Rbitmap_002edll-17"></a>
The file <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin/Rbitmap.dll</span> is not built automatically. 
Working in the directory <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/bitmap</span>,
install the <code>libpng</code> and <code>jpeg</code> sources in sub-directories. 
The <code>libpng</code> sub-directory must be named <span class="file">libpng</span> (as required
by the <code>libpng</code> documentation).  The <code>jpeg</code> sub-directory for
version 6b is named <span class="file">jpeg-6b</span>; if you use a different version, edit
<span class="file">Makefile</span> and change the definition of <code>JPEGDIR</code>.

   <p>Example:
<pre class="example">     &gt; tar xzvf libpng-1.2.8.tar.gz
     &gt; mv libpng-1.2.8 libpng
     &gt; tar xzvf jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p>Once everything is set up in directory <span class="file">bitmap</span>, <code>make</code>
in that directory or <code>make bitmapdll</code> in the parent directory
should build <span class="file">Rbitmap.dll</span> and install it in <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin</span>.

<p><a name="Windows-internationalization"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.5 Windows internationalization</h4>

<p>This version of R can be built with support for some multibyte
character sets such those used in Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

   <p>Define <code>SUPPORT_MBCS</code> in config.h to enable support in the R
engine for multi-byte character sets.  This is only useful if you have
an `East Asian' version of Windows, as only those versions have
multi-byte locales.  We have only tested this under Windows XP, but it
is expected to work under Windows 95/98/ME as well as NT-based versions
of Windows.

   <p>This also enables support for multi-byte locales in the RGui console,
pager, data and script editors (this is based loosely on the
Japanization patches by Nakama and Okada).  The Rterm command-line
editor is not supported in such locales.

   <p>Define both <code>SUPPORT_MBCS</code> and <code>SUPPORT_UTF8</code> in
<span class="file">config.h</span> to enable support in the R engine and in the Windows
graphics device for UTF-8 character sets.  Since there are no UTF-8
locales on Windows, this sets the locale to be UTF-8 and expects
input/output in UTF-8 so is only useful with a customized front-end to
<span class="file">R.dll</span>.

   <p>If any of these is defined you need the DLL <span class="file">msvcp60.dll</span> to be
installed.  It is on recent versions of Windows, and can be obtained
by an Internet search.

<p><a name="Building-the-recommended-packages"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.6 Building the recommended packages</h4>

   <p>To make DVI versions of the manuals use
<pre class="example">     cd ../../doc/manual

   <p class="noindent">(all assuming you have <span class="command">tex</span> and <span class="command">latex</span> installed and

<p><a name="Building-the-installers"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.8 Building the installers</h4>

<p>See <span class="file">installer/INSTALL</span>.  You need to have the files for a
complete R build, including bitmap and Tcl/Tk support and the manuals,
as well as the recommended packages.

   <p>Once everything is set up
<pre class="example">     make distribution
     make check-all
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will make all the pieces and the installers and put them in the
<span class="file">gnuwin32/cran</span> subdirectory, then check the build.  This works by
building all the parts in the sequence:

<pre class="example">     Rpwd.exe <span class="roman">(a utility needed in the build)</span>
     rbuild-no-mbcs <span class="roman">(the non-East Asian version of R.dll)</span>
     rbuild <span class="roman">(the executables, the <acronym>FAQ</acronym> docs etc.)</span>
     rpackage <span class="roman">(the base packages)</span>
     htmldocs <span class="roman">(the <acronym>HTML</acronym> documentation)</span>
     bitmapdll <span class="roman">(the bitmap support files)</span>
     recommended <span class="roman">(the recommended packages)</span>
     vignettes <span class="roman">(the vignettes in package </span><strong>grid</strong><span class="roman">:</span>
     	  <span class="roman"> only need if building from svn checkout)</span>
     manuals <span class="roman">(the PDF manuals)</span>
     rinstaller <span class="roman">(the install program)</span>
     crandir <span class="roman">(the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> distribution directory)</span>
</pre>
   <p>The parts can be made individually if a full build is not needed, but
earlier parts must be built before later ones.  (The <span class="file">Makefile</span>
doesn't enforce this dependency&mdash;some build targets force a lot of
computation even if all files are up to date.)  The first, third, fourth
and fifth targets are the default build if just <span class="samp">make</span> is run, but
the second (which builds the default version of <span class="file">R.dll</span>) needs to
be run first.

   <p>If you want to customize the installation by adding extra packages,
replace <code>make rinstaller</code> by something like
<pre class="example">     make rinstaller EXTRA_PKGS='pkg1 pkg2 pkg3'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">An alternative way to customize the installer starting with a binary
distribution is given in file <span class="file">installer/INSTALL</span>.

<p><a name="Checking-the-build"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.9 Checking the build</h4>

<p>You can test a build by (optionally) building the recommended packages
(see below) and running <code>make check</code>.  You may need to set
<code>TMPDIR</code> to the absolute path to a suitable temporary directory:
the default is <span class="file">c:/TEMP</span>.  (Use forward slashes and do not use a
path including spaces.)

<p><a name="Cross_002dbuilding-on-ix86-Linux"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.10 Cross-building on ix86 Linux</h4>

<p>You will need i386-mingw32 cross-compilers installed and in your path. 
There is currently a complete set of tools at
<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/mingw-cross4.tar.bz2">http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/mingw-cross4.tar.bz2</a> (Just
unpack this somewhere and put its <span class="file">bin</span> directory in your path.)

   <p>You will need <code>Perl</code>, <code>zip</code> and <code>unzip</code> installed
and <code>makeinfo</code> version 4.7 or later (part of GNU <code>texinfo</code>).

   <p>You also need the R source (<span class="file">R-2.x.y.tgz</span>).

   <p>Then: untar <span class="file">R-2.x.y.tgz</span> somewhere, and

<pre class="example">     cd /somewhere/R-2.x.y/src/gnuwin32
</pre>
   <p>Edit <span class="file">MkRules</span> to set <code>BUILD=CROSS</code> and the appropriate
paths (including <code>HEADER</code>) as needed.

   <p>Edit <span class="file">MkRules</span> to set the type(s) of help that you want built. (You
will not be able to cross-build <span class="file">.chm</span> files, so <code>WINHELP</code> is
automatically set to <code>NO</code>.)

   <p>You also need a working copy of <em>this version</em> of R on Linux:
uncomment and set <code>R_EXE</code> in <span class="file">MkRules</span> to point to it.

   <p>Then run <code>make</code> (and parallel make works reliably, unlike on Windows).

   <p>Packages can be made in the same way as natively: see <a href="#Add_002don-packages">Add-on packages</a>.

   <p>(It is possible to cross-build the installers using WINE, which we
leave as an exercise for the reader.)

   <p>To distribute a cross-build (or just to transfer it to a Windows machine
for testing) use
<pre class="example">     cd installer
     make imagedir
     zip -r9X rw2010.zip rw2010  # or something similar
</pre>
   <p>Currently we have not found a reliable way to convert base to lazy-loading
when cross-building, so it is left in the old format.

The <span class="file">bin/macosx</span> directory of a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> site contains
binaries for MacOS X (at the time of writing only for PowerPC) for a
base distribution and a large number of add-on packages from
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> to run on Mac OS X version 10.2.0 or higher.

   <p>The simplest way is to use <span class="file">R.dmg.sit</span>.  Just double-click on the

<span class="file">ReadMe.txt</span> inside the disk image and follow the instructions.

   <p>See the <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html">R for Mac OS X <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a> for more details.

<p><a name="Building-from-source-on-Mac-OS-X"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Building from source on Mac OS X</h3>

<p>If you want to build this port from the sources, you can read the above
mentioned <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html">R for Mac OS X <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a> for full details. You will need to collect
and install some tools as explained in the document. Than you have to
expand the R sources and configure R appropriately, for example

<pre class="example">     tar zxvf R-2.1.1.tgz
     cd R-2.1.1
     ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">sit back and wait. The last option <span class="option">--with-aqua</span> is needed only
if you want a Console GUI. 
The first two options are strongly recommended.

   <p>R is by default configured and installed as a framework called
<span class="file">R.framework</span>. The default path for <span class="file">R.framework</span> is
<span class="file">/Library/Frameworks</span> but this can be changed at configure time
specifying the flag <span class="option">--enable-R-framework[=DIR]</span> or at install

<pre class="example">     make prefix=/where/you/want/R.framework/to/go install

   <p class="noindent">the <span class="file">R.framework</span> has not to be specified in the path.

<p><a name="Add_002don-packages"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Add-on packages</h2>

<p><a name="index-Packages-19"></a>

   <p>It is helpful to use the correct terminology.  A <em>package</em> is
loaded from a <em>library</em> by the function <code>library()</code>.  Thus a
library is a directory containing installed packages; the main library
is <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/library</span>, but others can be used, for example by
setting the environment variable <span class="env">R_LIBS</span> or using the R function
<code>.libPaths()</code>.

<p><a name="Installing-packages"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Installing packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-Packages_002c-installing-20"></a>
Packages may be distributed in source form or compiled binary form. 
Installing source packages requires that compilers and tools (including
Perl 5.004 or later) be installed.  Binary packages are platform
specific and generally need no special tools to install, but see the
documentation for your platform for details.

   <p>Note that you need to specify implicitly or explicitly the library to
which the package is to be installed.  This is only an issue if you have
more than one library, of course.

   <p>To install packages from source in Unix use

<pre class="example">     R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/library <var>pkg1</var> <var>pkg2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The part <span class="samp">-l /path/to/library</span> can be omitted, in which case the
first library in <span class="env">R_LIBS</span> is used if set, otherwise the main library
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/library</span> is used.  (<span class="env">R_LIBS</span> is looked for in the
environment: <span class="file">.Renviron</span> is not read by <span class="command">R CMD</span>.)  Ensure
that the environment variable <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> is either unset (and
<span class="file">/tmp</span> exists and can be written in and executed from) or points to
a valid temporary directory.

   <p>There are a number of options available: use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code>
to see the current list.

   <p>The same command works in Windows if you have the source-code package
files (option &ldquo;Source Package Installation Files&rdquo; in the installer)
and toolset (see <a href="#The-Windows-toolset">The Windows toolset</a>) installed.

   <p><a name="index-install_002epackages-21"></a>Alternatively, packages can be downloaded and installed from within
R.  First set the option <code>CRAN</code> to your nearest <acronym>CRAN</acronym>
mirror using <span class="command">choooseCRANmirror()</span>.  Then download
and install packages <strong>pkg1</strong> and <strong>pkg2</strong> by

<pre class="example">     &gt; install.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Unless the library is specified (argument <code>lib</code>) the first library
in the library search path is used.  If you want to fetch a package and
all those it depends on that are not already installed, use e.g.
<pre class="example">     &gt; install.packages("Rcmdr", dependencies = TRUE)
</pre>
   <p>What <code>install.packages</code> does by default is different on Unix and
Windows.  On Unix-alikes (include MacOS X unless running from the `AQUA'
console) it consults the list of available <em>source</em> packages on
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> (or other repository/ies), downloads the latest version
of the package sources, and installs them (via <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>). 
On Windows it looks (by default) at the list of <em>binary</em> versions
of packages available for your version of R and downloads the latest
versions (if any), although optionally it will also download and install
a source package by setting the <code>type</code> argument.

   <p><code>install.packages</code> can install a source package from a local
<span class="file">.tar.gz</span> file by setting argument <code>repos</code> to <code>NULL</code>.

   <p>On Windows <code>install.packages</code> can also install a binary package
from a local <span class="file">zip</span> file by setting argument <code>repos</code> to
<code>NULL</code>.   <code>RGui.exe</code> has a menu <code>Packages</code> with a GUI
interface to <code>install.packages</code>, <code>update.packages</code> and
<code>library</code>.

   <p>As from R 2.1.0, <code>install.packages</code> can look in several
repositories, specified as a character vector by the argument
<code>repos</code>: these can include a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> mirror, Bioconductor,
Omegahat, local archives, local files, <small class="dots">...</small>).

   <p><a name="index-install_002ebinaries-22"></a>On Mac OS X <code>install.packages</code> works as it does on other Unix-like
systems, but there is an additional function <code>install.binaries</code>
that will download and install binary packages from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. 
These Macintosh binary package files have the extension <span class="samp">tgz</span>.  The
Aqua GUI provides for installation of either binary or source packages,
from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> or local files.

<p><a name="Customising-compilation-in-Windows"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Customising compilation in Windows</h4>

<p><a name="index-MakeDll-23"></a><a name="index-Makevars_002ewin-24"></a><a name="index-HELP-25"></a><a name="index-WINHELP-26"></a>
This section describes ways to customize package compilation using the
standard C/C++/Fortran compilers and tools.  For instructions on using
non-standard tools, see the <span class="file">README.packages</span> file.

   <p>The Makefiles can be customized: in particular the name of the DLL can
be set (for example we once needed <code>integrate-DLLNM=adapt</code>), the
compile flags can be set (see the examples in <span class="file">MakeDll</span>) and the
types of help (if any) to be generated can be chosen (variables
<code>HELP</code> and <code>WINHELP</code>). The simplest way to customize the
compilation steps is to set variables in a file
<span class="file">src/Makevars.win</span>, which will automatically be included by
<span class="file">MakeDLL</span>. For example, for RODBC <span class="file">src/Makevars.win</span> could
include the line
<pre class="example">     DLLLIBS+=-lodbc32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or, equivalently,
<pre class="example">     RODBC-DLLLIBS=-lodbc32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but in fact contains the single line
<pre class="example">     PKG_LIBS=-lodbc32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you have a file <span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span>, that will be used as the
makefile for source compilation in place of our makefile and
<span class="file">MakeDll</span> and <span class="file">src/Makevars.win</span> will be ignored.

   <p>Package-specific compilation flags can be overridden or added to using
the personal file <span class="file">$HOME/.R/Makevars.win</span>, or if that does not
exist, <span class="file">$HOME/.R/Makevars</span>. (See the <span class="file">rw-FAQ</span> for the meaning
of <code>$HOME</code>.)  For the record, the order of precedence is (last wins)
     <ul>
<li><span class="file">MakeDll</span> and <span class="file">MkRules</span>

     <li><span class="file">src/Makefile</span>

     <li><span class="file">src/Makevars.win</span> if it exists, otherwise <span class="file">src/Makevars</span>

     <li><span class="file">$HOME/.R/Makevars.win</span> if it exists, otherwise
<span class="file">$HOME/.R/Makevars</span>.

     <li><span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span> if present causes all of the above to be ignored. 
</ul>

   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: files <span class="file">src/Makefile</span> or <span class="file">src/Makevars</span> will
be used if they exist and the <span class="file">.win</span> equivalents do not.  Such
files included in package sources are usually designed for use under
Unix and are best removed.

   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: references to variables in <span class="file">R.dll</span> are converted to the
right form by using the header files.  You must include them.

   <p>For additional control, <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/Makefile</span>
contains additional make targets corresponding to various options to
<code>R CMD INSTALL</code>.  These assume that package <code>foo</code>'s source
code has been installed in directory
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/library/foo</span>. Then <code>make pkg-foo</code> is similar
to <code>R CMD INSTALL foo</code> (but the latter would require
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/library</span> to be the current directory).  Other
targets are
     <ul>
<li><code>ziponly-foo</code>, to use zip to compress the help files after building
the package. 
<li><code>ziphelp-foo</code> to both compress the help files and to keep the
originals. 
<li><code>zipdata-foo</code> to compress the data files.  This is recommended if
you have either many small data files (as in package <strong>Devore5</strong>) or a
few large data files. 
<li><code>pkgcheck-foo</code> to check the package (like <code>R CMD CHECK foo</code>). 
</ul>
   Using this approach allows variables to be set during the build, e.g.
<pre class="example">     make PKGDIR=/mysources RLIB=/R/library pkg-foo
</pre>
   <p>Some variables that may be used include:
     <ul>
<li><code>DEBUG=T</code> to compile with debugging information for <code>gdb</code>. 
<li><code>PKG_CFLAGS=</code> to specify options to the C compiler. 
<li><code>PKG_CPPFLAGS=</code> to specify options to the preprocessor. 
<li><code>PKG_CXXFLAGS=</code> to specify options to the C++ compiler. 
<li><code>PKG_FFLAGS=</code> to specify options to the Fortran compiler. 
<li><code>PKG_LIBS=</code> to specify options to the linking step making the DLL. 
<li><code>PKGDIR=/path/to/source</code> to specify the path to the package source files. 
<li><code>RLIB=/path/to/library</code> to specify the path to the library
where the package should be installed. 
</ul>
   For a complete list of variables, see the <span class="file">M*</span> files in
<var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32</span>.  The <code>PKG_*</code> flags are those
typically included in <span class="file">Makevars</span> files.

<p><a name="Customizing-compilation-under-Unix"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 Customizing compilation under Unix</h4>

<p>The R system and package-specific compilation flags can be overridden or
added to by setting the appropriate Make variables in the personal file
<span class="file">$HOME/.R/Makevars-$R_PLATFORM</span>, or if that does not exist,
<span class="file">$HOME/.R/Makevars</span>, where <span class="samp">R_PLATFORM</span> is the platform for
which R was built, as available in the <code>platform</code> component of the
R variable <code>R.version</code>.

   <p>Package developers are encouraged to use this mechanism to enable a
reasonable amount of diagnostic messaging (&ldquo;warnings&rdquo;) when compiling,
such as e.g. <span class="option">-Wall -pedantic</span> for tools from GCC, the Gnu

<h3 class="section">5.2 Updating packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-update_002epackages-27"></a><a name="index-Packages_002c-updating-28"></a>
The command <code>update.packages()</code> is the simplest way to ensure that
all the packages on your system are up to date.  Set the <code>repos</code>
argument as in the previous section.  The <code>update.packages()</code>
downloads the list of available packages and their current versions,
compares it with those installed and offers to fetch and install any
that have later versions on the repositories.

   <p>An alternative interface to keeping packages up-to-date is provided by
the command <code>packageStatus()</code>, which returns an object with
information on all installed packages and packages available at multiple
repositories.  The <code>print</code> and <code>summary</code> methods give an
overview of installed and available packages, the <code>upgrade</code> method
offers to fetch and install the latest versions of outdated packages.

Packages can be removed in a number of ways.  From a command prompt they
can be removed by

<pre class="example">     R CMD REMOVE -l /path/to/library <var>pkg1</var> <var>pkg2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p>From a running R process they can be removed by

<pre class="example">     &gt; remove.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"),
                       lib = file.path("path", "to", "library"))
</pre>
   <p>Finally, in most installations one can just remove the package directory
from the library.

   <p><strong>Note</strong>: only <code>remove.packages</code> can remove package
<em>bundles</em>.

<p><a name="Setting-up-a-package-repository"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.4 Setting up a package repository</h3>

<p><a name="index-Repositories-31"></a>
Utilities such as <code>install.packages</code> can be pointed at any
CRAN-style repository, and R users may want to set up their own.  The
`base' of a repository is a URL such as
<a href="http://www.omegahat.org/R">http://www.omegahat.org/R</a>: this must be an URL scheme that
<code>download.packages</code> supports (which also includes <code>ftp://</code> and
<code>file://</code>).  Under that base URL there should be directory trees
for one or more of the following types of package distributions:

     <ul>
<li><code>"source"</code>: located at <code>src/contrib</code> and containing
<span class="file">.tar.gz</span> files.

     <li><code>"win.binary"</code>: located at <code>bin/windows/contrib/x.y</code> for R
versions <code>x.y.z</code> and containing <span class="file">.zip</span> files.

     <li><code>"mac.binary"</code>: located at <code>bin/macosx/x.y</code> for R
versions <code>x.y.z</code> and containing <span class="file">.tgz</span> files. 
</ul>

   <p>Each terminal directory must also contain a <span class="file">PACKAGES</span> file.  This
can be a concatenation of the <span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span> files of the packages
separated by blank lines (provided there are no bundles), but only a few
of the fields are needed.  The simplest way to set up such a file is to
use function <code>write_PACKAGES</code> in the <strong>tools</strong> package, and its
help explains which fields are needed.

   <p>To add your repository to the list offered by <code>setRepositories()</code>,
see the help file for that function.

<p><a name="Internationalization"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">6 Internationalization and Localization</h2>

<p><a name="index-Internationalization-32"></a><a name="index-Localization-33"></a>
<em>Internationalization</em> refers to the process of enabling support
for non-English languages, and <em>localization</em> to adapting to a
specific country and language.

   <p>R has long worked in the ISO Latin-1 8-bit character set and so
covered English and most Western European languages (if not necessarily
their currency symbols).  What characters are valid in names was taken
from the current locale.  In general other locales with single-byte
encodings worked, but e.g. <code>postscript()</code> and <code>pdf()</code> need to
be told about the encoding in use.

   <p>Full internationalization can be enabled when R is built under
Unix-alikes by the (default) <span class="command">configure</span> option
<span class="option">--enable-mbcs</span>: see <a href="#Configuration-on-Unix">Configuration on Unix</a>.  Under Windows,
it is enabled by default in source builds, but support for `East Asian'
(Chinese/Japanese/Korean) languages is only enabled in the binary
install if it is selected in the installer.

   <p>All versions of R support all single-byte character sets that the
underlying OS can handle.  These are interpreted according to the
<a name="index-Locale-34"></a>current <code>locale</code>, a sufficiently complicated topic to merit a
separate section.  Fully internationalized versions can also handle most
multi-byte locales, in which a single character is represented by one,
two or more consecutive bytes: examples of such locales are those using
UTF-8 (becoming standard under Linux) and those for Chinese, Japanese
and Korean.  Note that only some of the graphics devices can handle
multi-byte or even non-Latin1 character sets: in particular
<code>postscript</code> and <code>PDF</code> are in practice restricted to ISO
Latin-1, -2 and -9.

   <p>The other aspect of the internationalization is support of the
translation of messages.  This is enabled in almost all builds of R
as from version 2.1.0.

<p><a name="Locales"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.1 Locales</h3>

<p><a name="index-Locale-35"></a>
A <em>locale</em> is a description of the local environment of the user,
including the preferred language, the encoding of characters, the
currency used and its conventions, and so on.  Aspects of the locale are
accessed by the R functions <code>Sys.getlocale</code> and
<code>Sys.localeconv</code>.

   <p>The system of naming locales is OS-specific.  There is quite wide
agreement on schemes, but not on the details of their implementation.  A
locale needs to specify
     <ul>
<li>A human language.  These are generally specified by a lower-case two-character
abbreviation following ISO 639.

     <li>A `territory', used mainly to specify the currency. These are generally
specified by an upper-case two-character abbreviation following ISO
3166.  Sometimes the combination of language and territory is used to
specify the encoding, for example to distinguish between traditional and
simplified Chinese.

     <li>A charset encoding, which determines both how a byte stream should be
divided into characters, and which characters the subsequences of bytes
represent.

     <li>Optionally, a modifier, for example to indicate that Austria is to be
considered pre- or post-Euro. 
</ul>

   <p>R is principally concerned with the first (for translations) and
third.  Note that the charset may be deducible from the language, as
some OSes offer only one charset per language, and most OSes have only
one charset each for many languages.  Note too the remark above about
Chinese.

<p><a name="Locales-under-Linux"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.1 Locales under Linux</h4>

<p>Modern Linux uses the XPG locale specifications which have the form
<code>en_GB</code>, <code>en_GB.utf8</code>, <code>aa_ER.utf8@saaho</code>,
<code>de_AT.iso885915@euro</code>, the components being in the order listed
above.  (See <span class="command">man locale</span> and <span class="command">locale -a</span> for more
details.)  Similar schemes (but often in different cases) are used by
most Unix-alikes.

<p><a name="Locales-under-Windows"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.2 Locales under Windows</h4>

<p>Windows also uses locales, but specified in a rather less concise way. 
Most users will encounter locales only via drop-down menus, but more
information and lists can be found at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/html/_crt_language_and_country_strings.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/html/_crt_language_and_country_strings.asp</a>.

<p><a name="Locales-under-Mac-OS-X"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.1.3 Locales under Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Mac OS X supports locales in its own particular way, but the R GUI tries
to make this easier for users. See

   <p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/</a>

<p class="noindent">for how users can set their locales. As with Windows, end users will
generally only see lists of languages/territories.

   <p>Internally Mac OS X uses a form similar to Linux but without specifying
the encoding (which is <code>.UTF-8</code>).

<p><a name="Localization-of-messages"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.2 Localization of messages</h3>

<p>The preferred language for messages is by default taken from the locale. 
This can be overridden first by the setting of the environment variable
<code>LANGUAGE</code> and then by the environment variables <code>LC_ALL</code>,
<code>LC_MESSAGES</code> and <code>LANG</code>. (The last three are normally used to
set the locale and so should not be needed, but the first is only used
to select the language for messages.)  The code tries hard to map locale
names to languages, even on Windows.

   <p>Note that you should not expect to be able to change the language once R
is running, and so <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> is not supported by
<code>Sys.setlocale</code>.

   <p>Messages are divided into <em>domains</em>, and translations may be
available for some or all messages in a domain.  R makes use of the
following domains.

     <ul>
<li>Domain <code>R</code> for basic C-level error messages.

     <li>Domain <code>R-</code><var>pkg</var> for the R <code>stop</code>, <code>warning</code> and
<code>message</code> messages in each package, including <code>R-base</code> for the
<code>base</code> package.

     <li>Domain <var>pkg</var> for the C-level messages in each package.

     <li>Domain <code>RGui</code> for the menus etc of the R for Windows GUI front-end.

   </ul>

   <p>Dividing up the messages in this way allows R to be extensible: as
packages are loaded, their message translation catalogues can be loaded
too.

   <p>Translations are looked for by domain according to the currently
specified language, as specifically as possible, so for example an
Austrian (<code>de_AT</code>) translation catalogue will be used in preference
to a generic German one (<code>de</code>) for an Austrian user.  However, if a
specific translation catalogue exists but does not contain a
translation, the less specific catalogues are consulted.  For example,
R has catalogues for <code>en_GB</code> that translate the Americanisms
(e.g., <code>gray</code>) in the standard messages into English.

   <p>Translations in the right language but the wrong charset can generally
be made use of by on-the-fly re-encoding.  The <code>LANGUAGE</code> variable
(only) can be a colon-separated list, for example <code>se:de</code>, giving a
set of languages in decreasing order of preference.  One special value
is <code>en@quot</code>, which can be used in a UTF-8 locale to have
English/American error messages with pairs of quotes translated to
Unicode directional quotes.

   <p>If no suitable translation catalogue is found or a particular message is
not translated in any suitable catalogue, English is used.

   <p>See <a href="http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html">http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html</a> for how to
prepare and install translation catalogues.

<p><a name="Essential-and-useful-other-programs-in-Unix"></a>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Essential and useful other programs in Unix</h2>

<p>This appendix gives details of programs you will need to build R on
Unix-like platforms, or which will be used by R if found by
<span class="command">configure</span>.

   <p>Remember that some package management systems (such as <acronym>RPM</acronym> and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
development version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension <span class="samp">-devel</span> or <span class="samp">-dev</span>: you need both versions
installed.

<p><a name="Essential-programs"></a>

<h3 class="section">A.1 Essential programs</h3>

<p>You need a means of compiling C and FORTRAN 77 (see <a href="#Using-FORTRAN">Using FORTRAN</a>).  Some add-on packages also need a C++ compiler.

   <p>Unless you do not want to view graphs on-screen you need <span class="samp">X11</span>
installed, including its headers and client libraries.  (On Fedora Core
Linux this means the <span class="samp">xorg-x11-devel</span> and <span class="samp">xorg-x11-libs</span>
RPMs, for example.  Older Linuxen used <span class="samp">XFree86-</span>.)  If you
really do not want these you will need to explicitly configure
R without X11, using <span class="option">--with-x=no</span>.

   <p>The command-line editing depends on the <code>readline</code> library
available from any <acronym>GNU</acronym> mirror: you will need a fairly recent
version.  Otherwise you will need to configure with
<span class="option">--with-readline=no</span> (or equivalent).

   <p>You will need Perl version 5.004 or later, available via
<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/</a>, to build any of the on-line
documentation.

   <p>You will not be able to build the info files unless you have
<span class="command">makeinfo</span> version 4.7 or later installed, and if not some of
the <acronym>HTML</acronym> manuals will be linked to <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. 
(<span class="command">makeinfo</span> version 4.7 is fairly recent, but version 4.6 is
known to create incorrect <acronym>HTML</acronym> files.)

   <p><a name="index-Vignettes-36"></a>The typeset documentation and building vignettes needs <span class="command">tex</span> and
<span class="command">latex</span>, or <span class="command">pdftex</span> and <span class="command">pdflatex</span>.

   <p>If you want to build from the R Subversion repository you need Perl,
<span class="command">makeinfo</span> and <span class="command">pdflatex</span>.

<p><a name="Useful-libraries-and-programs"></a>

<h3 class="section">A.2 Useful libraries and programs</h3>

<p>The use of encodings and the R <code>iconv</code> function depend on having
the system <code>iconv</code> function: this is part of recent versions of
<code>glibc</code> and many Unixes.  You can also install <acronym>GNU</acronym>
<code>libiconv</code> (which is not the same as that in <code>glibc</code>),
possibly as a plug-in replacement: see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/</a>.  Note that the R usage
requires <code>iconv</code> to be able to translate between <code>"latin1"</code>
and <code>"UTF-8"</code> and to recognize <code>""</code> as the current encoding &ndash;
this is not true of most commercial Unixes.

   <p>The ability to use translated messages makes use of <code>gettext</code> and
most likely needs <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>gettext</code>: you do need this to
work with new translations, but otherwise that contained in the R
sources will be used if no suitable external <code>gettext</code> is found.

   <p>The bitmapped graphics devices <code>jpeg()</code> and <code>png()</code> need the
appropriate headers and libraries installed: <code>jpeg</code> (version 6b
or later) or <code>libpng</code> (version 1.2.3 or later) and <code>zlib</code>
(version 1.1.3 or later) respectively.

   <p>The <code>bitmap</code> and <code>dev2bitmap</code> devices use ghostscript
(<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost</a>).

   <p>If you have them installed (including the appropriate headers and of
recent enough versions), <code>zlib</code>, <code>libbz2</code> and PCRE will be used
if specified by <span class="option">--with-zlib</span>, <span class="option">--with-bzlib</span> or
<span class="option">--with-pcre</span>: otherwise versions in the R sources will be
compiled in.  As the latter suffice and are tested with R you should
not need to change this.  In particular, the version of <code>zlib</code>
1.2.2 in the R sources has enhancements to work with large file
systems on 32-bit platforms.

<p><a name="Tcl_002fTk"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.2.1 Tcl/Tk</h4>

<p>The <strong>tcltk</strong> package needs Tcl/Tk installed: the sources are
available at <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">http://www.tcl.tk/</a>.  To specify the locations
of the Tcl/Tk files you may need the configuration options

     <dl>
<dt><span class="option">--with-tcltk</span><dd>use Tcl/Tk, or specify its library directory
<br><dt><span class="option">--with-tcl-config=</span><var>TCL_CONFIG</var><dd>specify location of <span class="file">tclConfig.sh</span>
<br><dt><span class="option">--with-tk-config=</span><var>TK_CONFIG</var><dd>specify location of <span class="file">tkConfig.sh</span>
</dl>

<p class="noindent">or use the configure variables <code>TCLTK_LIBS</code> and
<code>TCLTK_CPPFLAGS</code> to specify the flags needed for linking against
the Tcl and Tk libraries and for finding the <span class="file">tcl.h</span> and
<span class="file">tk.h</span> headers, respectively.

   <p>Versions of Tcl/Tk from 8.3 to 8.4.9 have been used successfully: 8.0 is
no longer supported.

<p><a name="Linear-algebra"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.2.2 Linear algebra</h4>

<p><a name="index-BLAS-library-37"></a>
The linear algebra routines in R can make use of enhanced BLAS (Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms, <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html">http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html</a>)
routines.  Some are compiler-system-specific (<code>libsunperf</code> on Sun
Sparc<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, <code>libessl</code> on IBM, <code>vecLib</code> on Mac OS
X) but ATLAS (<a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/</a>) is a &ldquo;tuned&rdquo;
BLAS that runs on a wide range of Unix-alike platforms.  If no more
specific library is found, a <code>libblas</code> library in the library path
will be used.  You can specify a particular BLAS library <em>via</em> a
value for the configuration option <span class="option">--with-blas</span> and not to use
an external BLAS library by <span class="option">--without-blas</span>.  (Alternatively,
the environment variable <span class="env">BLAS_LIBS</span> can be set, for example in
<span class="file">config.site</span>.)

   <p>For systems with multiple processors it is possible to use a
multi-threaded version of ATLAS.  An issue is that R profiling, which
uses the <code>SIGPROF</code> signal, may cause problems, and you may want to
disable profiling if you use a multi-threaded version of ATLAS.  You can
use a multi-threaded ATLAS by specifying

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lptf77blas -lpthread -latlas"
</pre>
   <p>Another tuned BLAS which is available for some processors under Linux is
by Kazushige Goto, currently available at
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/goto/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/goto/</a>.  Once this is is
installed, it can be used by one of

<pre class="example">     --with-blas=goto
     --with-blas=-lgoto
</pre>
   <p>Multi-threaded versions of Goto's BLAS are available (and indeed,
version 0.99-3 seems only to be available in a multithreaded version),
so please note the <em>caveat</em> in the previous paragraph.  These are
likely to require

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lgoto -lpthread"
</pre>
   <p>For Intel processors under Linux, Intel's Math Kernel Library
<a href="http://www.intel.com/software/products/mkl/">http://www.intel.com/software/products/mkl/</a>
can be used by

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lmkl -lguide -lpthread"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with the same caveat on multi-threading.  (Thanks to Andy Liaw for the
information.)

   <p>Note that the BLAS library will be used for several add-on packages as
well as for R itself.  This means that it is better to use a shared
BLAS library, as most of a static library will be compiled into the R
executable and each BLAS-using package.  In any case, the BLAS library
must be usable with dynamically-loadable code: this can be a problem
with ATLAS on some platforms as it is not by default built with
position-independent code.

   <p>You will need double-precision and double-complex versions of the BLAS,
but not single-precision nor complex routines.

   <p><a name="index-LAPACK-library-38"></a>Provision is made for using an external LAPACK library, principally to
cope with BLAS libraries which contain a copy of LAPACK (such as
<code>libsunperf</code> on Solaris and <code>vecLib</code> on Mac OS X).  However,
the likely performance gains are thought to be small (and may be
negative), and the default is not to search for a suitable LAPACK
library, this is definitely <strong>not</strong> recommended.  You can specify a
specific LAPACK library or a search for a generic library by the
configuration option <span class="option">--with-lapack</span>.  The default for
<span class="option">--with-lapack</span> is to check the BLAS library and then look for an
external library <code>-llapack</code>.  Sites searching for the fastest
possible linear algebra may want to build a LAPACK library using the
ATLAS-optimized subset of LAPACK.  To do so specify something like

<pre class="example">     --with-lapack="-L/path/to/libs -llapack -lcblas"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">since the ATLAS subset of LAPACK depends on <code>libcblas</code>.  A value
for <span class="option">--with-lapack</span> can be set <em>via</em> the environment variable
<span class="env">LAPACK_LIBS</span>, but this will only be used if <span class="option">--with-lapack</span>
is specified (as the default value is <code>no</code>) and the BLAS library
does not contain LAPACK.

   <p>If you do use <span class="option">--with-lapack</span>, be aware of potential problems
with bugs in the LAPACK 3.0 sources (or in the posted corrections to those
sources).  In particular, bugs in <code>DGEEV</code> and <code>DGESDD</code> have
resulted in error messages such as

<pre class="example">     DGEBRD gave error code -10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(from the Debian <code>-llapack</code> which was current in late 2002).  Other
potential problems are incomplete versions of the libraries: for example
<code>libsunperf</code> from Sun Forte 6.x was missing the entry point for
<code>DLANGE</code> and <code>vecLib</code> has omitted the BLAS routine
<code>LSAME</code>.  For problems compiling LAPACK using recent versions of
<span class="samp">gcc</span> on <span class="samp">ix86</span> Linux, see <a href="#New-platforms">New platforms</a>.

   <p>As with all libraries, you need to ensure that they and R were
compiled with compatible compilers and flags.  For example, this means
that on Sun Sparc using the native compilers the flag <span class="option">-dalign</span>
is needed so <code>libsunperf</code> can be used.

   <p>An ATLAS `tuned' BLAS can also be used on Windows: see see <a href="#Getting-the-source-files">Getting the source files</a> when building from source, and
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/rw-FAQ.html">R Windows <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a> for adding pre-compiled support to binary versions. 
Goto's BLAS can also be used when building from source.

   <p>Note that under Unix (but not under Windows) if R is compiled
against a non-default BLAS, then all BLAS-using packages must also be. 
So if R is re-built after ATLAS is installed, then packages such as
<strong>quantreg</strong> will need to be re-installed.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Configuration on Unix</h2>

<p><a name="Configuration-options"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.1 Configuration options</h3>

<p><span class="command">configure</span> has many options: running

<pre class="example">     ./configure --help
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will give a list.  Probably the most important ones not covered
elsewhere are (defaults in brackets)

     <dl>
<dt><span class="option">--with-x</span><dd>use the X Window System [yes]
<br><dt><span class="option">--x-includes=</span><var>DIR</var><dd>X include files are in <var>DIR</var>

<br><dt><span class="option">--with-readline</span><dd>use readline library (if available) [yes]
<br><dt><span class="option">--enable-R-profiling</span><dd>attempt to compile support for <code>Rprof()</code> [yes]
<br><dt><span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span><dd>build R as a shared library [no]
</dl>

<p class="noindent">You can use <span class="option">--without-foo</span> or <span class="option">--disable-foo</span> for the
negatives.

   <p>You will want to use <span class="option">--disable-R-profiling</span> if you are building
a profiled executable of R (e.g. with <span class="samp">-pg)</span>.

   <p>Flag <span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span> causes the make process to build R as
a dynamic (shared) library, typically called <span class="file">libR.so</span>, and link
the main R executable <span class="file">R.bin</span> against that library.  This can
only be done if all the code (including system libraries) can be
compiled into a dynamic library, and there may be a
performance<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
penalty.  So you probably only want this if you will be using an
application which embeds R.  Note that C code in packages installed
on a R system linked with <span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span> are linked
against the dynamic library and so such packages cannot be used from a
R system built in the default way.

<p><a name="Internationalization-support"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.2 Internationalization support</h3>

<p>As from version 2.1.0, R has some support for multi-byte character
sets (<acronym>MBCS</acronym>), in particular for UTF-8 locales (which are
usually identified by suffix <code>.utf8</code>, something like
<code>en_GB.utf8</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  UTF-8 is an encoding of Unicode and in principle
covers all human languages simultaneously: however, a given system may
not have fonts capable of displaying more than a few of these languages.

   <p>To enable UTF-8 support, configure with default <span class="option">--enable-mbcs</span>. 
This will check for a large number of features, notably support for the
C99/UNIX98 wide character functions and for UTF-8 or MBCS support in
X11.  If enough of these are found, <code>MBCS</code> will be listed as one
of the &ldquo;Additional capabilities&rdquo;.  Then if R is started in a UTF-8
locale it assumes that the terminal will supply and display
UTF-8-encoded characters<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.  If run in a single-byte locale, R behaves almost
exactly as if it was configured with <span class="option">--disable-mbcs</span>.

   <p>A version of R with MBCS support can also be run in other multi-byte
locales, for example those using the EUC-JP, EUC-KR and EUC-TW
encodings.  A very few parts of R currently assume that ASCII
characters never occur as part of multi-byte character sequences, which
is true of UTF-8 and the EUC-* locales but not some Chinese and Korean
locales.

   <p>Translation of messages is supported via GNU <code>gettext</code> unless
disabled by the configure option <span class="option">--disable-nls</span> or the
underlying OS has insufficiently standard C functions to support it. 
The <code>configure</code> report will show <code>NLS</code> as one of the
`Additional capabilities' if support has been compiled in, and running
in an English locale (but not the <code>C</code> locale) will include
<pre class="example">       Natural language support but running in an English locale
</pre>
   <p>in the greeting on starting R.

<p><a name="Configuration-variables"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.3 Configuration variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-configure-39"></a>If you need or want to set certain configure variables to something
other than their default, you can do that by either editing the file
<span class="file">config.site</span> (which documents all the variables you might want to
set) or on the command line as

<pre class="example">     ./configure VAR=<var>value</var>

   <p class="noindent">If you are building in a directory different from the sources, there can

<p>One common variable to change is <span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span>, which defaults to

<p><a name="Setting-the-browser"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.3.2 Setting the browser</h4>

<p>Another precious variable is <span class="env">R_BROWSER</span>, the default browser, which

a full path.

<p><a name="Compilation-flags"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.3.3 Compilation flags</h4>

<p>If you have libraries and header files, e.g., for <acronym>GNU</acronym>
readline, in non-system directories, use the variables <code>LDFLAGS</code>
(for libraries, using <span class="samp">-L</span> flags to be passed to the linker) and
<code>CPPFLAGS</code> (for header files, using <span class="samp">-I</span> flags to be passed to
the C/C++ preprocessors), respectively, to specify these locations. 
These default to <code>LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib</code> and
<code>CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include</code> to catch the most common cases (but
beware that <code>LDFLAGS</code> may need altering for 64-bit OSes).  If
libraries are still not found, then maybe your compiler/linker does not
support re-ordering of <span class="option">-L</span> and <span class="option">-l</span> flags (this has been
reported to be a problem on HP-UX with the native <span class="command">cc</span>).  In
this case, use a different compiler (or a front end shell script which
does the re-ordering).

<p><a name="Using-make"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.4 Using make</h3>

<p><a name="index-make-40"></a>
To compile R, you will most likely find it easiest to use GNU
<span class="command">make</span>.  On Solaris 2.6/7/8 in particular, you need a version of
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <span class="command">make</span> different from 3.77; 3.79.1 works fine, as
does the Sun <span class="command">make</span>.  The native <span class="command">make</span> is reported to
fail on SGI Irix 6.5 and Alpha/OSF1 (aka Tru64).

   <p>To build in a separate directory you need a <span class="command">make</span> that uses the
<code>VPATH</code> variable, for example <acronym>GNU</acronym> <span class="command">make</span>, or Sun
<span class="command">make</span> on Solaris 2.7/8/9 (but not earlier).

   <p>If you want to use a <span class="command">make</span> by another name, for example if your
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <span class="command">make</span> is called <span class="samp">gmake</span>, you need to set the
variable <code>MAKE</code> at configure time, for example

   <p><a name="index-configure-41"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure MAKE=gmake
</pre>
   <p><a name="Using-FORTRAN"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.5 Using FORTRAN</h3>

<p><a name="index-FORTRAN-42"></a>

   <p>To compile R, you need a FORTRAN compiler or <span class="command">f2c</span>, the
FORTRAN-to-C converter (<a href="http://www.netlib.org/f2c">http://www.netlib.org/f2c</a>).  The default
is to search for <span class="command">g77</span>, <span class="command">f77</span>, <span class="command">xlf</span>,
<span class="command">frt</span>, <span class="command">pgf77</span>, <span class="command">fort77</span>, <span class="command">fl32</span>,
<span class="command">af77</span>,<span class="command">f90</span>, <span class="command">xlf90</span>, <span class="command">pgf90</span>,
<span class="command">epcf90</span>, <span class="command">f95</span>, <span class="command">fort</span>, <span class="command">xlf95</span>,
<span class="command">ifc</span>, <span class="command">efc</span>, <span class="command">pgf95</span> <span class="command">lf95</span>, and
<span class="command">gfortran</span> (in that order)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and then for <span class="command">f2c</span>, and use whichever is found
first; if none is found, R cannot be compiled.  The search mechanism
can be changed using the configure variables <code>F77</code> and <code>F2C</code>
which specify the commands that run the FORTRAN 77 compiler and
FORTRAN-to-C converter, respectively.  If <code>F77</code> is given, it is
used to compile FORTRAN; otherwise, if <code>F2C</code> is given, f2c is used
even if a FORTRAN compiler would be be available.  If your FORTRAN
compiler is in a non-standard location, you should set the environment
variable <span class="env">PATH</span> accordingly before running <span class="command">configure</span>, or
use the configure variable <code>F77</code> to specify its full path.

   <p>If your FORTRAN libraries are in slightly peculiar places, you should
also look at <span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> or your system's equivalent to make
sure that all libraries are on this path.

   <p>You must set whatever compilation flags (if any) are needed to ensure
that FORTRAN <code>integer</code> is equivalent to a C <code>int</code> pointer and
FORTRAN <code>double precision</code> is equivalent to a C <code>double</code>
pointer.  This is checked during the configuration process.  Because
of this, f2c will not be accepted on a 64-bit platform as it produces
64-bit integers, incompatible with C's <code>int</code> on such platforms.

   <p>Some of the FORTRAN code makes use of <code>COMPLEX*16</code> variables, which
is a FORTRAN 90 extension.  This is checked for at configure
time<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>, but you may need to avoid
compiler flags<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a> asserting
FORTRAN 77 compliance.

   <p><a name="index-BLAS-library-43"></a>For performance reasons<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a> you may want to choose a FORTRAN 90/95 compiler.

   <p>If you use <span class="command">f2c</span> you may need to ensure that the FORTRAN type
<code>integer</code> is translated to the C type <code>int</code>.  Normally
<span class="file">f2c.h</span> contains <span class="samp">typedef long int integer;</span>, which will work
on a 32-bit platform but not on a 64-bit platform.

<p><a name="Using-gfortran"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.5.1 Using gfortran</h4>

<p><span class="command">gfortran</span> is the F95 compiler that is part of <code>gcc 4.0.0</code>. 
At least on <code>ix86</code> and <code>x86_64</code> Linux and MacOS X there is a
problem with using the dynamic version of the Fortran runtime
<code>libgfortran</code>: if this is loaded redirection of C <span class="file">stdin</span>
(which R uses in many of its scripts) becomes non-functional.  A
workaround is to set the environment variable <span class="env">GFORTRAN_STDIN_UNIT</span>
to <code>-1</code>, but versions before 10 April 2005 had a bug causing the
setting to be ignored.  This problem has been fixed for <code>gcc 4.0.1</code>
and the workaround will become unnecessary.  The version of
<span class="command">gfortran</span> shipping with Fedora Core 4 seems to have the
workaround in place.

<p><a name="Compile-and-load-flags"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.6 Compile and load flags</h3>

<p>A wide range of flags can be set in the file <span class="file">config.site</span> or as
configure variables on the command line.  We have already mentioned

     <dl>
<dt><code>CPPFLAGS</code><dd>header file search directory (<span class="option">-I</span>) and any other miscellaneous
options for the C and C++ preprocessors and compilers
<br><dt><code>LDFLAGS</code><dd>path (<span class="option">-L</span>), stripping (<span class="option">-s</span>) and any other miscellaneous
options for the linker
</dl>

<p class="noindent">and others include

     <dl>
<dt><code>CFLAGS</code><dd>debugging and optimization flags, C
<br><dt><code>MAIN_CFLAGS</code><dd>ditto, for compiling the main program
<br><dt><code>SHLIB_CFLAGS</code><dd>for shared libraries
<br><dt><code>FFLAGS</code><dd>debugging and optimization flags, FORTRAN
<br><dt><code>MAIN_FFLAGS</code><dd>ditto, for compiling the main program
<br><dt><code>SHLIB_FFLAGS</code><dd>for shared libraries
<br><dt><code>MAIN_LDFLAGS</code><dd>additional flags for the main link
<br><dt><code>SHLIB_LDFLAGS</code><dd>additional flags for linking the shared libraries
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Library paths specified as <span class="option">-L/lib/path</span> in <code>LDFLAGS</code> are
collected together and prepended to <span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> (or your
system's equivalent), so there should be no need for <span class="option">-R</span> or
<span class="option">-rpath</span> flags.

   <p>To compile a profiling version of R, one might for example want to
use <span class="samp">MAIN_CFLAGS=-pg</span>, <span class="samp">MAIN_FFLAGS=-pg</span>,
<span class="samp">MAIN_LDFLAGS=-pg</span> on platforms where <span class="samp">-pg</span> cannot be used
with position-independent code.

   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: it may be necessary to set <code>CFLAGS</code> and
<code>FFLAGS</code> in ways compatible with the libraries to be used: one
possible issue is the alignment of doubles, another is the way
structures are passed.

<p><a name="Platform-notes"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.7 Platform notes</h3>

<p>This section provides some notes on building R on different Unix-like
platforms.  These notes are based on tests run on one or two systems in
each case with particular sets of compilers and support libraries. 
Success in building R depends on the proper installation and functioning
of support software; your results may differ if you have other versions
of compilers and support libraries.

   <p>Many 32-bit systems have a means of using files &gt; 2Gb, and most are
based on that in the Single Unix specification: see
<a href="http://ftp.sas.com/standards/large.file/x_open.20Mar96.html">http://ftp.sas.com/standards/large.file/x_open.20Mar96.html</a>. 
However, this is only covered under Linux and Solaris.

<p><a name="Linux"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.1 Linux</h4>

<p><a name="index-Linux-44"></a>
Linux is the main development platform for R, so compilation from the
sources is normally straightforward.

   <p>Remember that some package management systems (such as <acronym>RPM</acronym> and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
developer version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension <span class="samp">-devel</span> or  <span class="samp">-dev</span>: you need both versions
installed.  So please check the <code>configure</code> output to see if the
expected features are detected: if for example <span class="samp">readline</span> is
missing add the package containing its headers.

   <p>When R has been installed from a binary distribution there are
sometimes problems with missing components such as the Fortran
compiler.  Searching the <span class="samp">R-help</span> archives will normally reveal
what is needed.

   <p>It seems that the <span class="samp">gcc</span> compilers normally produce PIC code on
<span class="samp">ix86</span> Linux but do not necessarily do so on 64-bit versions such
as that for AMD Opteron.  So care can be needed with BLAS libraries and
when building R as a shared library to ensure that
position-independent code is used in any static libraries (such as the
Tcl/Tk libraries, <code>libpng</code>, <code>libjpeg</code> and <code>zlib</code>) which
might be linked against.  Fortunately these are normally built as shared
libraries with the exception of the ATLAS BLAS libraries.

   <p>For versions with both 64- and 32-bit support, it is likely that
<pre class="example">     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib64 -L/usr/local/lib"
</pre>
   <p>is appropriate since most (but not all) software installs its 64-bit
libraries in <span class="file">/usr/local/lib64</span>.

   <p>64-bit versions of Linux are built with support for files &gt; 2Gb, but
32-bit versions usually are not.  This can be enabled for Linux kernels
2.4.x or later by the configure option <span class="option">--enable-linux-lfs</span>: it
tests for Linux, a suitable kernel and a 32-bit <span class="samp">long</span> type. 
A discussion of which Linux systems support large files can be found at
<a href="http://www.suse.de/~aj/linux_lfs.html">http://www.suse.de/~aj/linux_lfs.html</a>: it has been available
since about 2001.

   <p>R used to include the compiler flag <span class="option">-mieee-fp</span>, but it seems
this was really an alias for the linker flag <span class="option">-lieee</span>.  Neither
are needed for a modern Linux (e.g. using <code>glibc</code> 2.2 or 2.3) but
could conceivably be needed on an older version.

   <p>Several Linux distributions have shipped unreleased versions of
<code>gcc 4.0.0</code> and its Fortran compiler <span class="command">gfortran</span> (see the
separate comments).  Some versions of <code>gcc4</code> (such as that in
Fedora Core 3) produce incorrect code.  In our experiments <code>gcc
3.4.x</code> always produced faster and more reliable code.

   <p>For some comments on building on an Itanium (<code>ia64</code>) Linux system
with <span class="command">gcc</span> and Intel compilers see
<a href="http://www.nakama.ne.jp/memo/ia64_linux/">http://www.nakama.ne.jp/memo/ia64_linux/</a>.

<p><a name="Mac-OS-X"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.2 Mac OS X</h4>

<p><a name="index-Mac-OS-X-45"></a>
You can build R as a Unix application on Mac OS X using the Apple
Developer Tools and <span class="command">f2c</span> or <span class="command">g77</span> or
<span class="command">gfortran</span>.  You will also need to install an X sub-system or
configure with <span class="option">--without-x</span>. The X window manager is part of the
standard Mac OS X distribution since Mac OS X version 10.3 (Panther).

   <p>For more information on how to find these tools please read the
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html">R for Mac OS X <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a>.

   <p>If you use the X window manager and prefer <code>Terminal.app</code> to
<code>xterm</code>, you should be aware that R, like many Unix tools,
uses the existence of a <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable to
determine whether an X system is running.  This affects the default
graphics device for the commmand line version of R and the behaviour
of the <code>png()</code> and <code>jpeg</code> devices.

   <p><a name="index-BLAS-library-46"></a><a name="index-LAPACK-library-47"></a>The <code>vecLib</code> library of Mac OS X &gt;= 10.2.2 can be used <em>via</em> the
configuration options

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-framework vecLib" --with-lapack
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to provide higher-performance versions of the BLAS and LAPACK
routines.  With <span class="command">gcc 3.1</span> that appears to be the only way to
build R, as the Fortran support routines in <code>libg2c</code> cannot be
linked into a dynamic library.  (We have had reports of success and of
failure with <span class="command">gcc 3.3</span>.)

<p><a name="Solaris"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.3 Solaris on Sparc</h4>

<p><a name="index-Solaris-48"></a>
R has been built successfully on Solaris 8 aka Solaris 2.8 aka SunOS
5.8 using <span class="command">gcc</span>/<span class="command">g77</span> and the SunPro WorkShop&nbsp;6<!-- /@w --> (aka
Forte 6) compilers and the `Sun ONE Studio 7 Compiler Suite' (aka Forte
7), and less regularly on Solaris 9 and 10.  <acronym>GNU</acronym>
<span class="command">make</span> was needed prior to Solaris 2.7 for building other than
in the source tree, and is sometimes needed to establish the correct
dependencies when rebuilding.

   <p>The Solaris versions of several of the tools needed to build R
(e.g. <span class="command">make</span>, <span class="command">ar</span> and <span class="command">ld</span>) are in
<span class="file">/usr/ccs/bin</span>, so if using those tools ensure this is in your
path.

   <p><span class="command">gcc</span> 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 generate incorrect code on 32-bit Solaris
builds with optimization, but versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.3 and later work
correctly.  (<code>make check</code> fails at the first attempt to plot.)

   <p>If using <span class="command">gcc</span>, do ensure that the compiler was compiled for the
version of Solaris in use.  (This can be ascertained from <span class="command">gcc
-v</span>.)  <span class="command">gcc</span> makes modified versions of some header files, and
so (for example) <span class="command">gcc</span> compiled under Solaris 2.6 will not
compile R under Solaris 2.7.  Also, do ensure that it was compiled
for the assembler/loader in use: if you download <span class="command">gcc</span> from
<a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com">http://www.sunfreeware.com</a> then you need to download
<code>binutils</code> too.  To avoid all these pitfalls we strongly
recommended you compile <span class="command">gcc</span> from the sources yourself.

   <p>It was reported by Mike Pacey that Sun Forte 9 requires
<code>-xopenmp=stubs</code> added to <code>LDFLAGS</code>.

   <p>When using the SunPro compilers do <em>not</em> specify <span class="option">-fast</span>, as
this disables <acronym>IEEE</acronym> arithmetic and <span class="command">make check</span> will
fail.  The maximal set of optimization options known to work is

<pre class="example">     -xlibmil -xO5 -dalign
</pre>
   <p>We have found little performance difference between <span class="command">gcc</span> and
<span class="command">cc</span> but considerable benefit from using a SunPro Fortran
compiler: the <span class="command">gcc</span>/<span class="command">f77</span> combination works well.  For
many C++ applications (e.g. package <strong>Matrix</strong>) Forte 7 requires
<code>-lCstd</code>, which the configure script will add to
<code>SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS</code> if it identifies the compiler correctly.

   <p>A 32-bit version of R is built without large file support and so can
only handle files up to 2Gb (unlike 64-bit versions).  According to
<span class="samp">man lfcompile</span> this restriction can be removed if
<span class="option">-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE=1</span> is added to
<span class="samp">CFLAGS</span>.

   <p>To compile for a 64-bit target on Solaris (which needs an UltraSparc
chip and for support to be enabled in the OS) with the Forte 6 and 7
compilers we used

<pre class="example">     CC="cc -xarch=v9"
     CFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign"
     F77="f95 -xarch=v9"
     FFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign"
     CXX="CC -xarch=v9"
     CXXFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -dalign"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in <span class="file">config.site</span>.

   <p>For 64-bit compilation with <span class="command">gcc</span> 3.2.x and later we used

<pre class="example">     CC="gcc -m64"
     F77="g77 -m64"
     CXX="g++ -m64"
     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/local/lib"
</pre>
   <p>Note that <span class="samp">/usr/local/lib/sparcv9</span> will need to be in the
<span class="samp">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> during configuration.

   <p><a name="index-BLAS-library-49"></a><a name="index-LAPACK-library-50"></a>
Note that using <span class="command">f95</span> allows the Sun performance library
<code>libsunperf</code> to be selected: it will not work with <span class="command">f77</span>,
nor with <span class="command">g77</span>.  <code>libsunperf</code> contains both BLAS and LAPACK
code, and <span class="option">--with-lapack</span> is recommended for 32-bit builds using
<span class="command">f95</span>, but not for 64-bit builds where on our test system it
failed in both Forte 6U1 and 7, albeit in different ways.  Our
experience has been that ATLAS's BLAS is faster than <code>libsunperf</code>,
especially for complex numbers.

   <p>Some care is needed to ensure that libraries found by
<span class="command">configure</span> are compatible with the R executable and modules, as
the testing process will not detect many of the possible problems.  For
32-bit builds under <span class="command">cc</span> the flag <span class="option">-dalign</span> is needed for
some of the Sun libraries: fortunately the equivalent flag for
<span class="command">gcc</span>, <span class="option">-mno-unaligned-doubles</span>, is the default.  In
theory, libraries such as <code>libpng</code>, <code>libjpeg</code>, <code>zlib</code> and
the ATLAS libraries need to be built with a <code>pic</code> or <code>PIC</code>
flag, which could be a problem if static libraries are used.  In
practice this seems to give little problem for 32-bit builds.

   <p>For a 64-bit build, 64-bit libraries must be used.  As the configuration
process by default sets <code>LDFLAGS</code> to <span class="samp">-L/usr/local/lib</span>,
you may need to set it to avoid finding 32-bit addons (as in the
<span class="command">gcc -m64</span> example above).  It is possible to build Tcl/Tk as
64-bit libraries with the configure option <span class="command">--enable-64bit</span>, but
only with the Forte compiler (and not with <span class="command">gcc</span>) as of Tcl/Tk 8.4.5.

<p><a name="HP_002dUX"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.4 HP-UX</h4>

<p><a name="index-HP_002dUX-51"></a>
The reports on HP-UX here predate R 2.0.0.

   <p>R has been built successfully on HP-UX 10.2 and HP-UX 11.0 using both
native compilers and <span class="command">gcc</span>.  However, 10.2 has not been tested
since R 1.4.0.  By default, R is configured to use <span class="command">gcc</span> and
<span class="command">g77</span> on HP-UX (if available).  Some installations of
<span class="command">g77</span> only install a static version of the <span class="command">g2c</span> library
that cannot be linked into a shared library since its files have not
been compiled with the appropriate flag for producing position
independent code (<acronym>PIC</acronym>).  This will result in <span class="command">make</span>
failing with a linker error similar to

<pre class="example">     ld: CODE_ONE_SYM fixup to non-code subspace in file foo.o -
     shared library must be position independent. Use +z or +Z to recompile.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(<span class="option">+z</span> and <span class="option">+Z</span> are the <acronym>PIC</acronym> flags for the native
compiler <span class="command">cc</span>.)  If this is the case you either need to modify
your <span class="command">g77</span> installation or configure with

<pre class="example">     F77=fort77
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to specify use of the native <acronym>POSIX</acronym>-compliant FORTRAN 77
compiler.

   <p>You may find that <span class="command">configure</span> detects other libraries that R
needs to use as shared libraries but are only available as static
libraries.  If you cannot install shared versions you will need to tell
<span class="command">configure</span> not to use these libraries, or make sure they are
not in the library path.  The symptom will be the linker error shown in
the last paragraph.  Static libraries that might be found and would
cause problems are

<pre class="example">     BLAS                   <span class="roman">use --without-blas</span>
     Tcl/Tk                 <span class="roman">use --without-tcltk</span>
     libpng                 <span class="roman">use --without-libpng</span>
     jpeg                   <span class="roman">use --without-jpeglib</span>
     zlib                   <span class="roman">use --without-zlib</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and <code>bzip2</code> and <code>pcre</code> are problematic when building
<span class="file">libR.so</span>, only.  These can be avoided by <span class="option">--without-bzlib</span>
and <span class="option">--without-pcre</span> respectively, but these are the defaults.

   <p>Some versions of <span class="command">gcc</span> may contain what appears to be a bug at
the <span class="option">-O2</span> optimization level that causes

<pre class="example">     &gt; 2 %/% 2
     [1] 1
     &gt; 1:2 %/% 2
     [1] 0 0     # wrong!!
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will cause <span class="command">make check</span> to fail.  If this is the case, you
should use <code>CFLAGS</code> to specify <span class="option">-O</span> as the optimization
level to use.

   <p>Some systems running HP-UX 11.0 may have a <span class="command">gcc</span> that was
installed under HP-UX 10.2.  Between versions 10.2 and 11.0 HP-UX
changed its support functions for <acronym>IEEE</acronym> arithmetic from the
recommended functions of the <acronym>IEEE</acronym> standard to the ones
specified in the C9x draft standard.  In particular, this means that
<code>finite</code> has been replaced by <code>isfinite</code>.  A <span class="command">gcc</span>
configured for HP-UX 10.2 run on 11.0 will not find <code>isfinite</code>, and
as a result <span class="command">configure</span> does not recognize the machine as fully
supporting <acronym>IEEE</acronym> arithmetic and so will not complete.  The best
solution is to install a properly configured <span class="command">gcc</span>.  An
alternative work-around is to add <span class="option">-DIEEE_754</span> to the
<code>CFLAGS</code> variable.

   <p>You can configure R to use both the native <span class="command">cc</span> and
<span class="command">fort77</span> with

<pre class="example">     ./configure CC=cc F77=fort77
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">f90</span> insists on linking against a static <span class="file">libF90.a</span> which
typically resides in a non-standard directory (e.g.,
<span class="file">/opt/fortran90/lib</span>).  Hence, to use <span class="command">f90</span> one needs to
add this directory to the linker path via the configure variable
<code>LDFLAGS</code> (e.g., <code>./configure F77=f90
LDFLAGS=/opt/fortran90/lib</code>).

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.5 IRIX</h4>

<p><a name="index-IRIX-52"></a>
R 2.1.0 has been successfully built on IRIX64 6.5 using both
<span class="command">gcc</span> and the native (MipsPro 7.4) compiler. However, neither
version has passed <span class="command">make check</span> due to a problem with time
zones (see below).  A 64-bit executable has not been successfully
built.

   <p>To build R with <span class="command">gcc</span> use the following configuration flags
<pre class="example">     CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/freeware/include"
     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/freeware/lib32"
</pre>
   <p>To build the Tcl/Tk package you need to add

<pre class="example">     --with-tclconfig=/usr/freeware/lib/tclConfig.sh
     --with-tkconfig=/usr/freeware/lib/tkConfig.sh
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">since these configuration scripts are not on your path.

   <p>To build R with the native compilers, use the following configuration flags

<pre class="example">     CC=cc F77=f77 CXX=CC
     CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/freeware/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/freeware/lib32"
     CFLAGS="-O2" FFLAGS="-O2" CXXFLAGS="-O2"
     --with-bzlib=yes
</pre>
   <p>The MipsPro compiler will not build the bzlib library, so you must use
the external one provided by SGI as a freeware package.

   <p>After configuration, it is necessary to use <span class="command">gmake</span> instead of
the native <span class="command">make</span> to build R.

   <p>There is a problem with the time zones on IRIX (originally reported by
George N. White III for 1.9.0) which will cause the <code>strptime</code>
tests to fail unless Arthur Olson's timezone data
<a href="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/">ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/</a> has been installed (see also
<a href="http://cspry.co.uk/computing/Indy_admin/TIMEZONE.html">http://cspry.co.uk/computing/Indy_admin/TIMEZONE.html</a>) and
<code>-ltz</code> is added to the list of libraries (for example, in
environment variable <span class="env">LIBS</span>).

<p><a name="Alpha_002fOSF1"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.6 Alpha/OSF1</h4>

<p>R has been built successfully on an Alpha running OSF1 V4.0 / V5.1
using <span class="command">gcc</span>/<span class="command">g77</span> and <span class="command">cc</span>/<span class="command">f77</span>. 
Mixing <span class="command">cc</span> and <span class="command">g77</span> fails to configure.  The
<span class="command">configure</span> option <span class="option">--without-blas</span> was used since the
native blas seems not to have been built with the flags needed to
suppress <code>SIGFPE</code>'s.  Currently R does not set a signal handler
for <code>SIGFPE</code> on platforms that support <acronym>IEEE</acronym> arithmetic,
so these are fatal.

   <p>At some point in the past using <span class="command">cc</span> required <span class="option">-std1</span> to
be set so <span class="samp">__STDC__</span> was defined.  As far as we know this is no
longer needed, and <span class="command">configure</span> no longer sets it, but it does
set <span class="option">-ieee_with_inexact</span> for the C compiler and <span class="option">-fpe3</span>
for the Fortran compiler (and <span class="option">-mieee-with-inexact</span> and
<span class="option">-mieee</span> for <span class="command">gcc</span>/<span class="command">g77</span>).

<p><a name="Alpha_002fFreeBSD"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.7 Alpha/FreeBSD</h4>

<p>Attempts to build R on an Alpha with FreeBSD 4.3 have been only
partly successful.  Configuring with <span class="option">-mieee</span> added to both
<code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>FFLAGS</code> builds successfully, but tests fail with
<code>SIGFPE</code>'s.  It would appear that <span class="option">-mieee</span> only defers these
rather than suppressing them entirely.  Advice on how to complete this
port would be greatly appreciated.

<p><a name="AIX"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.7.8 AIX</h4>

<p><a name="index-AIX-53"></a>
On AIX 4.3.3 and AIX 5.1, it was found that the use of &ldquo;run time
linking&rdquo; (as opposed to normal AIX style linking) was required.  For
this, the R main program must be linked to the runtime linker with
the <span class="option">-brtl</span> linker option, and shareable objects must be enabled
for runtime linking with the <span class="option">-G</span> linker option.  Without these
options, the AIX linker would not automatically link to any shared
object with a <span class="file">.so</span> extension.  Also, the R main program would
be unable to dynamically load modules (such as X11) with the
<code>dlopen</code> call.

   <p>When setting <code>MAIN_LDFLAGS</code> and <code>SHLIB_LDFLAGS</code> accordingly,
note that linker flags must be escaped using <span class="samp">-Wl,</span> if
<span class="command">gcc</span> is used for linking: use <span class="samp">MAIN_LDFLAGS="-Wl,brtl"</span>
and <span class="samp">SHLIB_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-G"</span> in this case.

   <p>Harald Servat Gelabert &lt;harald at cepba dot upc dot es&gt; reported
success building R 1.7.0 under AIX 5.1 with

<pre class="example">     CC=xlc
     F77=xlf
     CXX=xlC
     CFLAGS='-O3 -qstrict -qmaxmem=8192'
     FFLAGS='-O3 -qstrict -qmaxmem=8192'
     CXXFLAGS='-O2 -qmaxmem=8192'
     MAIN_LDFLAGS='-Wl,-brtl'
     SHLIB_LDFLAGS='-Wl,-G'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but was unable to use the X libraries or the native BLAS (ESSL) and so
used <span class="option">--without-x --without-blas</span>.

   <p>Tim Hoar &lt;thoar at cgd dot ucar dot edu&gt; reported success building
R 1.9.0 under AIX 5.1 in 64-bit mode with

<pre class="example">     OBJECT_MODE=64
     CC=/usr/bin/xlc_r
     F77=/usr/bin/xlf_r
     CXX=/usr/bin/xlC_r
     LDFLAGS='-brtl'
     CFLAGS='-O -qstrict'
     FFLAGS='-O -qstrict'
     CXXFLAGS='-O -qstrict'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the <code>X11()</code> device worked.  [His system required the
<span class="file">Makeconf</span> file to be edited to replace <span class="file">/lib/crt0.o</span> by
<span class="file">/lib/crt0_64.o</span> in <code>R_XTRA_LIBS</code>, but <span class="command">configure</span> now
tries to detect this.]

   <p>Paul Boutros reported success building R 2.0.1 under AIX 5.2 with
<code>gcc 3.3.2</code> using
<pre class="example">     OBJECT_MODE=64
     MAIN_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-brtl
     SHLIB_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-G
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(note it is <code>Wl</code> (W ell) not <code>W1</code> (W one)).

   <p>We understand that <span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span> does not work under AIX.

<p><a name="Building-the-GNOME-console"></a>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Building the <acronym>GNOME</acronym> console</h2>

<p>This interface is experimental and incomplete.  The console offers a
basic command line editing and history mechanism, along with tool and
button bars that give a point-and-click console to some R commands. 
Many of the features of the console are currently stubs.

   <p>Two graphics devices have been available but are currently unbundled. 
The <code>gtk()</code> graphics device is a port of the <code>x11()</code> device to
<acronym>GDK</acronym> (the GIMP Drawing Kit), and is available from
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> as package <strong>gtkDevice</strong>: this cooperates rather better
with the console than the <code>x11()</code> device.  The <code>gnome()</code>
device used the <acronym>GNOME</acronym> canvas, and is not currently available.

   <p>The sources for the <acronym>GNOME</acronym> console for R are now available
as package <strong>gnomeGUI</strong> on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> and <em>via</em> Subversion by
<pre class="example">     svn co https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/gnomeGUI
</pre>
   <p>You need to have built R first with the <span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span>
option, and installed R to where you are going to use it from.

   <p>Please check you have all the requirements.  You need at least the
following packages (or later) installed

<pre class="example">     audiofile-0.2.1
     esound-0.2.23
     glib-1.2.10
     gtk+-1.2.10
     imlib-1.9.10
     ORBit-0.5.12
     gnome-libs-1.4.1.2
     libxml-1.8.16
     libglade-0.17
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It is preferable to have a complete installation of the <acronym>GNOME</acronym>
desktop environment.  If you use Linux, then this should be provided
with your distribution.

   <p>Remember that some package management systems (such as <acronym>RPM</acronym> and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
developer version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension <span class="samp">-devel</span>.  If you use a pre-packaged version of
<acronym>GNOME</acronym> then you must have the developer versions of the above
packages in order to compile the R-GNOME console.

   <p>It is possible to install the front-end in the same way as an R
package, via <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> or <code>install.packages</code>.

   <p>For greater control, it can be configured and built independently of
R.  Create a build directory, and from there run

<pre class="example">     /path/to/gnomeGUI/configure R_HOME=/path/to/R/installation
     make
     make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This installs the two files <span class="file">bin/exec/Rgnome</span> and
<span class="file">share/glade/gnome-interface.glade</span> in <var>R_HOME</var>.

<p><a name="Enabling-search-in-HTML-help"></a>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Enabling search in <acronym>HTML</acronym> help</h2>

<p>There is a search engine available from the front page of the <acronym>HTML</acronym>
help system, the page that is displayed by <code>help.start()</code>.  The
search engine is written in Java and invoked by Javascript code, so the
first thing to do is to ensure that both are enabled in your favourite
browser.  Then try it and see: with most browsers you should see

<pre class="example">     Applet SearchEngine started
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">displayed in the status bar.  (Internet Explorer shows <code>Applet
started</code>.) Then click on one of the keywords and after a short delay
(several seconds) you should see a page of search results.

   <p>If this fails you should double-check that Java is enabled in your
browser by visiting a page such as
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.jsp</a> (although that
will fail for earlier versions of Java such as the Microsoft JVM which
do work with R).  Java 1.1 is sufficent.

   <p>On Mozilla-based browsers the links on the results page will
become inactive if you return to it: to work around this you can open
a link in a new tab or window.

   <p>Many thanks to Marc Schwartz in tracking down many of these issues with
enabling the Java search engine.

<p><a name="The-Windows-toolset"></a>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E The Windows toolset</h2>

<p>If you want to build R from the sources in Windows, you will need
to collect, install and test an extensive set of tools.  See
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/</a> for the current locations
and other updates to these instructions.

   <p>Some of these tools are also necessary for building add-on packages from
source.  (Most Windows users will not need to do that; see <a href="#Add_002don-packages">Add-on packages</a>
for details.)  We have found that the build process for R is quite
sensitive to the choice of tools:  please follow our instructions
<strong>exactly</strong>, even to the choice of particular versions of the tools. 
The build process for add-on packages is somewhat more forgiving, but we
recommend using the exact toolset at first, and only substituting other
tools once you are familiar with the process.

   <p><em>This section contains a lot of prescriptive comments.  They are
here as a result of bitter experience.  Please do not report problems
to R-help unless you have followed all the prescriptions.</em>

   <p>You will certainly need the following items to produce a working copy
of R.  See the subsections below for detailed descriptions.
     <ul>
<li>The command line tools
<li>Perl
<li>The MinGW compilers
</ul>
   For building simple packages containing data or R source
but no compiled code, only the first two of these are needed.

   <p>A complete build of R including compiled <acronym>HTML</acronym> help files and
PDF manuals, and producing the standalone installer
<span class="file">rw2011.exe</span> will also need the following:
     <ul>
<li>The Microsoft <acronym>HTML</acronym> Help Workshop
<li>LaTeX
<li>The Inno Setup installer
</ul>

   <p>Your path should include `.' first, then the <span class="file">bin</span> directories of
the tools, perl, minGW, and LaTeX, as well as the Help Workshop directory. 
Do not use filepaths containing spaces: you can always use the
short forms (found by <code>dir /x</code> at the Windows command line). 
It is essential that the directory containing the
command line tools comes first or second in the path:  there are
typically like-named tools in other directories, and they will
<strong>not</strong> work.  The ordering of the other directories is less
important, but if in doubt, use the order above.

   <p>Edit <var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/MkRules</span> to set the appropriate paths as
needed and to set the type(s) of help that you want built. 
<strong>Beware</strong>: <span class="file">MkRules</span> contains tabs and some editors
(e.g. WinEdt) silently remove them.

   <p>Set the appropriate environment variables.

   <p>Our toolset contains copies of Cygwin dlls that may conflict
with other ones on your system if both are in the path
at once.  The normal recommendation is to delete the older ones;
however, at one time we found our tools did not work with a newer
version of the Cygwin dlls, so it is safest not to have
any other version of the Cygwin dlls in your path.

<p><a name="The-command-line-tools"></a>

<h3 class="section">E.1 The command line tools</h3>

<p>You will need suitable versions of at least <code>basename</code>, <code>cat</code>,
<code>comm</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>diff</code>, <code>echo</code>,
<code>egrep</code>, <code>expr</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>gawk</code>, <code>grep</code>,
<code>gzip</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>makeinfo</code>, <code>mkdir</code>,
<code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>sh</code>, <code>sort</code>,
<code>texindex</code> and <code>touch</code>; we use those from the Cygwin
distribution (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>) or compiled from the sources. 
You will also need <code>zip</code> and <code>unzip</code> from the Info-ZIP project
(<a href="http://www.info-zip.org">http://www.info-zip.org</a>).  We have packaged a set of all of these
tools at <a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/tools.zip">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/tools.zip</a>.

   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: `Native' ports of make are <strong>not</strong> suitable
(including that at the mingw site).  There were also problems with
several earlier versions of the cygwin tools and dll.  To avoid
frustration, please use our tool set, and make sure it is at the front
of your path (including before the Windows system directories).  If you
are using a Windows shell, type <code>PATH</code> at the prompt to find out.

<p><a name="Perl"></a>

<h3 class="section">E.2 Perl</h3>

<p>You will need the Windows port of <code>perl5</code>.  A package containing
this is available from
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/</a>.

   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: you do need the <em>Windows</em> port and not the Cygwin one.

<p><a name="The-MinGW-compilers"></a>

<h3 class="section">E.3 The MinGW compilers</h3>

<p>You need a recent version of the MinGW port of <code>gcc</code> from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/</a>.  See the notes on
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools</a> for updates.

   <p>The most recent installer is called <span class="file">MinGW-4.1.0.exe</span>, which
downloads components for SourgeForge. We suggest you select the core
packages and the candidate compilers (<code>gcc-3.4.4</code>), and then at the
next screen select just <code>gcc-core</code>, <code>gcc-g++</code> and
<code>gcc-g77</code> (and no compilers in the code list).  The screen showing
confirmation of the selections will then look like:

</pre>
   <p><a name="The-Microsoft-HTML-Help-Workshop"></a>

<h3 class="section">E.4 The Microsoft <acronym>HTML</acronym> Help Workshop</h3>

<p>To make compiled html (<span class="file">.chm</span>) files you will need the
Microsoft <acronym>HTML</acronym> Help Workshop, currently available for download at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmicrosofthtmlhelpdownloads.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmicrosofthtmlhelpdownloads.asp</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/appndx/appa06.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/appndx/appa06.htm</a>.

   <p>You may need this on the same drive as the other tools. (Although we
have successfully used it elsewhere, others have reported problems).

   <p>To skip building compiled html help, set <code>WINHELP=NO</code> in <span class="file">MkRules</span>. 
In this case the Help Workshop will not be needed.

<p><a name="LaTeX"></a>

<h3 class="section">E.5 LaTeX</h3>

<p>The <code>fptex</code> distribution of LaTeX (via
<a href="http://www.fptex.org">http://www.fptex.org</a>) includes a suitable port of <code>pdftex</code>. 
We have also used <code>miktex</code> (<a href="http://www.miktex.org">http://www.miktex.org</a>), which
needs some customization:  see

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix F New platforms</h2>

<p>There are a number of sources of problems when installing R on a new
hardware/OS platform.  These include

   <p><strong>Floating Point Arithmetic</strong>: R supports the <acronym>POSIX</acronym>,
SVID and <acronym>IEEE</acronym> models for floating point arithmetic.  The
<acronym>POSIX</acronym> and SVID models provide no problems.  The <acronym>IEEE</acronym>
model however can be a pain.  The problem is that there is no agreement
on how to set the signalling behaviour; Sun/Sparc, SGI/IRIX and ix86
Linux require no special action, FreeBSD requires a call to (the macro)
<code>fpsetmask(0)</code> and OSF1 requires that computation be done with a
<span class="option">-ieee_with_inexact</span> flag etc.  On a new platform you must find
out the magic recipe and add some code to make it work.  This can often
be done via the file <span class="file">config.site</span> which resides in the top level
directory.

   <p>Beware of using high levels of optimization, at least initially.  On
many compilers these reduce the degree of compliance to the
<acronym>IEEE</acronym> model.  For example, using <span class="option">-fast</span> on the Solaris
SunPro compilers causes R's <code>NaN</code> to be set incorrectly.

   <p><strong>Shared Libraries</strong>: There seems to be very little agreement
across platforms on what needs to be done to build shared libraries. 
there are many different combinations of flags for the compilers and
loaders.  <acronym>GNU</acronym> libtool cannot be used (yet), as it currently
does not fully support FORTRAN (and will most likely never support
<span class="command">f2c</span>:  one would need a shell wrapper for this).  The technique
we use is to first interrogate the X window system about what it does
(using <span class="command">xmkmf</span>), and then override this in situations where we
know better (for tools from the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Compiler Collection and/or
platforms we know about).  This typically works, but you may have to
manually override the results.  Scanning the manual entries for
<span class="command">cc</span> and <span class="command">ld</span> usually reveals the correct incantation. 
Once you know the recipe you can modify the file <span class="file">config.site</span>
(following the instructions therein) so that the build will use these
options.

   <p>It seems that <span class="samp">gcc 3.4.x</span> and later on <span class="samp">ix86</span> Linux defeat
attempts by the LAPACK code to avoid computations entirely in
extended-precision registers, so file <span class="file">src/modules/lapack/dlamc.f</span>
may need to be compiled without optimization.  If configure detects
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Fortran it adds flag <span class="option">-ffloat-store</span> which
suffices, but it is possible that <span class="file">src/modules/lapack/Makefile</span>
will need to be edited to remove optimization on other platforms.

   <p>If you do manage to get R running on a new platform please let us
know about it so we can modify the configuration procedures to include
that platform.

   <p>If you are having trouble getting R to work on your platform please
feel free to get in touch to ask questions.  We have had a fair amount
of practice at porting R to new platforms <small class="enddots">....</small>
